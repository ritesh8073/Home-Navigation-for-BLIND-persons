# Home Navigation for Blind Persons

## Overview
Home Navigation for Blind Persons is an assistive technology project aimed at providing visually impaired individuals with an intelligent navigation system for safe and efficient movement within indoor environments. The system utilizes sensors, AI, and audio feedback to guide users in real-time.

## Features
- **Obstacle Detection**: Uses ultrasonic or LiDAR sensors to detect obstacles and provide alerts.
- **Voice Assistance**: Offers real-time voice instructions for navigation.
- **Smart Object Recognition**: Identifies common household objects and informs the user.
- **Customizable Routes**: Users can predefine routes for specific locations within their home.
- **Emergency Assistance**: Includes an SOS feature for emergencies.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensors, Camera Module
- **Software**: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask (for API & backend services)
- **Audio Feedback**: Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech Recognition

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi or compatible microcontroller
- Required Python libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask, SpeechRecognition

### Steps
